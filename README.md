# My-Data-Science-Projects

[Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Guided%20Project_%20Star%20Wars%20Survey/Basics.ipynb): This project is based on the Star Wars survey of FiveThirtyEight team. The ranking and number of views are analyzed based on some factors like gender, education, location, etc.

[SAT scores of NYC schools and Demographics](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Guided%20Project_%20Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data/Schools.ipynb): This project analyzes New York City schools according to the SAT score and tries to find correlations between demographics like race, gender, class size, and more.

[Dissatisfaction in Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Clean%20And%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys/Clean%20And%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb): In this project, I work with exit surveys from two institutes in Queensland, Australia, and try to analyze if employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction.

[Finding the best markets to advertise](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb): In this project I help an elearning company to find the best market to advertise in based on the [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/)

[Mobile App for Lottery Addiction](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project_%20Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction/Basics.ipynb): A medical institute decides to build a mobile app to help lottery addicts to estimate the probability of winning. This project provides the engineering team of the institute some functions to calculate the requested probabilities.

[Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes/spam_filter.ipynb): In this project, a spam filter function is written using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam and non-spam.

[Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project_%20Winning%20Jeopardy/jeopardy.ipynb):In this project, a dataset of Jeopardy questions is used to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help to win.

[Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project_%20Predicting%20Car%20Prices/Pred_car_prices.ipynb): This project is about using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict car prices.

[Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project_%20Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals-Update/Basics.ipynb): In this project, I have used and compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest algorithms to predict bike rentals. I also tried to find the best parameters to prevent overfitting and get good results.

[Predicting the stock market](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project_%20Predicting%20the%20stock%20market/predict_stock_price.ipynb): This project is about using the linear regression model to predict the daily price of the S&P500 Index. Making predictions only one day ahead is also practiced.

[Predict Survival on Titanic](https://github.com/hammadasif402/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project_predict_survuval_on_titanic/titanic.ipynb): In this project is about predicting which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic.
